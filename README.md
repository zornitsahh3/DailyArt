This is a mobile app project developed for my masters' class in NBU university "Developing mobile apps with AndroidStudio using Java/Kotlin". 
The app is called "Daily Art" and the idea is to store worldwide famous paintings as a catalog with an option for the user to browse paintings and details for them and to save their favorites. The app supports both local paintings (stored in the app) and oaintings fetched from the Metropolitan Museum of Art API.
